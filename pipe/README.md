Problem "Pipe"

The automatic line produces polyethylene pipe in sections. Production is carried out in batches. X grams of raw materials are used for 1 m of pipe. To organize work on one batch of pipes, the following data must be prepared:
the number of segments in the batch;
lengths of segments to be produced (technological limitation of the maximum length of the segment is 12 m, the minimum length of the segment is 50 cm);
the maximum and minimum length of the segment in the batch (the data is necessary to determine the positions of the limiters of the cutters of the automatic line);
calculation of the volumes of raw materials required for the production of the entire batch.
The program must ensure the input of the necessary data from the keyboard, the formation of an array of segment lengths and other indicators specified in the task.
Note - in the problem, use a dynamic array to represent the lengths of segments.

* Additional task:
Generate data for manufacturing N batches of pipe (using toothed dynamic arrays).
