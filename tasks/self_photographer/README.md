## Task: Self-photographer

The RGB (Red, Green, Blue) format is often used to represent color images. One pixel corresponds to 3 numbers, each of which contains the value of the corresponding color. The values themselves are encoded with numbers from 0 to 255.

Create 3 matrices containing the colors of the image pixels of size NxM (the colors can be generated by random numbers) and perform the following image transformations:

1. **Get a Grayscale Image:**
   For this, it is necessary to calculate the brightness of each pixel. One of the brightness calculation methods is determined by the formula:
   \[ Y = 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B \]
   
Here, \( R \), \( G \), and \( B \) represent the values of the corresponding color channels.
