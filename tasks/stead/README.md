# Task: A Plot of Land

A rectangular plot of land is divided on the plan into horizontal and vertical rows. To determine reclamation measures in each fragment of the plot at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical rows, height measurements were made (the result of the measurement can be both a positive and a negative number). The unit of measurement of height is meters.

Calculate in which of the rows of the plot the average height value has the maximum deviation from zero. Output the number of the row, location (horizontally or vertically), and deviation.
