Task "Self-photographer"

- The RGB (Red, Green, Blue) format is often used to represent color images. One pixel corresponds to 3 numbers, each of which contains the value of the corresponding color. The values themselves are encoded with numbers from 0 to 255. Create 3 matrices containing the colors of the image pixels of size NxM (the colors can be generated by random numbers) and perform the following image transformations:
- Get a grayscale image. For this, it is necessary to calculate the brightness of each pixel. One of the brightness calculation methods is determined by the formula Y=0.2126R+ 0.7152G+0.0722B
- Reduce the noise in the input image using a median filter. The median filter can be implemented in the form of a 3x3 pixel window that moves sequentially across the image. The pixel values in the window are sorted in ascending order and the value in the middle is calculated - it is the result of the filter (median). The central pixel in the window is replaced by the resulting median. The median filter is used for grayscale images.
