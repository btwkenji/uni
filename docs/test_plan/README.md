## 1. Introduction

The Test Plan document outlines the testing approach, objectives, scope, schedule, and resources for the Serene Sakura Anime Recommendations Engine project.

## 2. Test Objectives

The primary objectives of testing for the Serene Sakura project are as follows:

- Validate the functionality of the anime recommendations engine.
- Verify the reliability and stability of the system.
- Assess the performance of the recommendation algorithms.
- Identify and track defects for resolution.

## 3. Scope

The testing scope includes:

- Functional testing of the anime recommendation features.
- Performance testing to evaluate system responsiveness.
- Security testing for data protection.
- Regression testing after each software update.
- User acceptance testing to gather feedback.

## 4. Test Strategy

The test strategy includes:

- Comprehensive unit testing by developers.
- System testing with a focus on integration and functionality.
- User acceptance testing with real users.
- Performance testing using simulated user loads.
- Security testing to ensure data protection.
- Regression testing to ensure existing features are not affected.

## 5. Test Environment

The testing environment consists of:

- Operating Systems: Linux, NixOs, Windows, macOS
- Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Brave, DuckDuckGo
- Test Tools: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, Jira
- Test Data: Diverse anime datasets covering different genres and languages.

## 6. Test Deliverables

The following test deliverables will be produced:

- Test Plan
- Test Cases
- Test Execution Reports
- Defect Reports
- Performance Test Results
- Security Test Results

## 7. Test Schedule

The testing phase is scheduled to begin on July 1, 2024, and conclude on August 31, 2024. The detailed test schedule is available in the project timeline.

## 8. Test Cases

Test cases will be designed to cover the following scenarios:

- Positive test cases for valid recommendations.
- Negative test cases for invalid inputs.
- Performance test cases for various user loads.
- Security test cases for data protection.

## 9. Defect Tracking

Defects will be tracked using Jira. The testing team will report and prioritize defects based on their severity and impact on the system.

## 10. Risks and Assumptions

- **Risks:** Unavailability of real user data, compatibility issues on specific platforms, potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Assumptions:** Development will be completed as scheduled, and the testing team will have access to diverse anime datasets for testing.

## 11. Approvals
