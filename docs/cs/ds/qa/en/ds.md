# Discrete Structures

## 1. Content and Objectives of Discrete Mathematics

Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics that studies objects and phenomena that are separate, discontinuous, partial, or quantitatively limited. The primary focus of discrete mathematics is the study of objects that can only take distinct values rather than any values within a specific interval.

### Objectives of discrete mathematics include:

- **Set Theory**: Study of sets and their properties.

- **Graph Theory**: Study of graphs, representing collections of vertices and edges.

- **Logic**: Investigation of principles of understanding and deriving the truth of statements.

- **Number Theory**: Study of integers and their properties.

- **Combinatorics**: Investigation of combinations and permutations of objects.

- **Automata Theory**: Study of automata and formal languages.

- **Cryptography**: Application of mathematical methods for information security.

- **Coding Theory**: Study of methods for encoding information for transmission and storage.

- **Algorithm Theory**: Investigation of algorithms and their efficiency.

- **Game Theory**: Study of strategies in game theory.

- **Sampling Theory and Probability**: Study of probabilistic models and statistical methods.

Discrete mathematics plays a crucial role in computer science, making its study key to understanding algorithms, data structures, computational theory, and other aspects of computer science.

## 2. Set Theory: Study of Sets and Their Properties

### Concept of a Set:

**Set** - a mathematical object that represents a collection of elements without a specified order. Elements of a set can be objects of any type: numbers, symbols, other sets, etc.

- The symbol that denotes a set is curly braces {}. For example, the set of natural numbers from 1 to 5 can be represented as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

### Ways of Defining a Set:

#### There are various ways to define a set. The main ones include:

#### Enumeration of elements: A set can be defined by listing all its elements in curly braces.

- **Example**: A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

#### Description using characteristic property:
- A set can be described by a condition satisfied by its elements. For example, the set of even natural numbers:
  - B={x∣x∈N,x is even}B={x∣x∈N,x is even}
    - This is read as "B is the set of x such that x is a natural number and x is even."

#### Graphical method (Venn diagram):
- Representation of sets using circles and their intersections. Each circle represents a set, and their intersection shows common elements.
  - For example:
    - (C = {1, 2, 3}), (D = {3, 4, 5})

#### Formula representation:
- Some sets can be defined using mathematical formulas.
  - For example: $E={x2∣x∈Z}E={x2∣x∈Z}$
    - This is the set of all squares of integers.

These methods allow for the specification and description of sets in various ways based on the requirements of the task or context.

## 3. Relations Between Sets. Geometric Representation of Sets.

### Relations Between Sets:

The relation between two sets A and B is a subset of the Cartesian product A × B, where A × B represents the set of all possible pairs $((a, b))$, where $(a \in A)$ and $(b \in B)$.

#### Possible types of relations:

- **Equality**:
  - If every element of set A is also an element of set B, and vice versa, they are equal, denoted as $(A = B)$.

- **Subset**:
  - If every element of set A is an element of set B, then A is a subset of B, denoted as $(A \subseteq B)$.

- **Disjointness**:
  - If no element of set A is an element of set B, and vice versa, they are disjoint, denoted as $(A \cap B = \emptyset)$ $(where (\emptyset)$ is the empty set).

- **Intersection**:
  - A relation containing only those pairs $((a, b))$ for which $(a)$ is an element of $A$ and $(b)$ is an element of B. Denoted as $(A \cap B)$.

- **Union**:
  - A relation containing pairs that belong to either A or B (or both). Denoted as $(A \cup B)$.

- **Geometric Representation of Sets**:
  - Geometric representation of sets can be done using Venn diagrams or graphical representations.

- **Venn Diagrams**:
  - Used to represent relationships and intersections between sets. Each circle represents a set, and their intersection indicates common elements.

- **Graphical Representations**:
  - Use of graphs to represent elements of sets and relationships between them.
  - Each element of a set can be represented as a vertex, and relationships as edges.
  - For example, for sets $(A = \{1, 2, 3\})$ and $(B = \{2, 3, 4\})$:

```haskell
A:   1 -- 2 -- 3
B:       |
      4 -- 
```

These methods help visualize relationships between sets and indicate their intersections and relationships.

## 4. Basic Operations on Sets.

### Basic operations on sets include various actions and operations that can be performed with sets. Here are the fundamental operations on sets:

#### Union: The union of two sets A and B is a set that contains all unique elements belonging to either A, B, or both. Denoted as \(A \cup B\).

- Example:

```haskell
A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3, 4, 5}
A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

#### Intersection: The intersection of two sets A and B is a set that contains all unique elements belonging to both A and B. Denoted as \(A \cap B\).

- Example:

```haskell
A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3, 4, 5}
A ∩ B = {3}
```

#### Difference: The difference of two sets A and B is a set that contains all unique elements belonging to A but not to B. Denoted as \(A \setminus B\) or \(A - B\).

- Example:

```haskell
A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3, 4, 5}
A \ B = {1, 2}
```

#### Complement: The complement of set A with respect to the universal set U is a set containing all elements that belong to U but not to A. Denoted as \(A'\) or \(A^c\).

- Example:

```haskell
U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, A = {1, 2, 3}
A' = {4, 5}
```

#### Symmetric Difference: The symmetric difference of sets A and B is a set containing all unique elements belonging to either A or B, but

 not both. Denoted as \(A \triangle B\).

- Example:

```haskell
A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3, 4, 5}
A △ B = {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

These operations allow for various manipulations with sets and analysis of their relationships.

# Properties of Set Operations

Properties of set operations help understand the rules that are followed when using union, intersection, difference, and other operations. Here are some basic properties of set operations:

### Commutativity:

- **Union ( ∪ )**:
  - $(A \cup B = B \cup A)$

- **Intersection ( ∩ )**:
  - $(A \cap B = B \cap A)$

Union and intersection of sets are commutative operations, meaning the order of sets is not important.

### Associativity:

- **Union ( ∪ )**:
  - $((A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C))$

- **Intersection ( ∩ )**:
  - $((A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C))$

Union and intersection of sets are associative operations, meaning the order of operation is not important in consecutive applications.

### Distributivity:

- **Intersection over Union**:
  - $(A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C))$

- **Union over Intersection**:
  - $(A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C))$

Union and intersection distribute over each other with respect to other operations.

### Idempotence:

- **Union ( ∪ )**:
  - $(A \cup A = A)$

- **Intersection ( ∩ )**:
  - $(A \cap A = A)$

Union or intersection of a set with itself yields the same set.

### Identity:

- **Union ( ∪ )**:
  - $(A \cup \emptyset = A)$

- **Intersection ( ∩ )**:
  - $(A \cap U = A)$

Union with an empty set or intersection with the universal set yields the same set.

### Complementarity:

- **Union with Complement**:
  - $(A \cup A' = U)$

- **Intersection with Complement**:
  - $(A \cap A' = \emptyset)$

Union with the complement gives the universal set, and intersection with the complement gives the empty set.

These properties aid in working with sets and ensure their adherence to mathematical principles.

## 6. Cartesian Product of Sets

**Cartesian Product of Sets** is a mathematical operation defined for two sets A and B, forming a new set where each element is an ordered pair, with the first element from set A and the second from set B. The Cartesian product is denoted as $(A \times B)$.

- For example, if $(A = \{1, 2\})$ and $(B = \{a, b\})$, then their Cartesian product is:
  - $(A \times B = \{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)\})$

### The Cartesian Product of Sets has several important properties:

- The number of elements in the Cartesian product is the product of the number of elements in the original sets: $(|A \times B| = |A| \cdot |B|)$.

- The Cartesian product is associative: $((A \times B) \times C = A \times (B \times C))$.

- The Cartesian product is commutative: $(A \times B = B \times A)$.

### Some possible exam questions about the Cartesian product of sets:

#### How is the Cartesian product of sets defined?
- The Cartesian product of sets A and B, denoted as $(A \times B)$, is the set of all possible ordered pairs $((a, b))$, where $(a)$ belongs to set A and $(b)$ belongs to set B.

#### Give an example of the Cartesian product for specific sets.
- For example, if $(A = \{1, 2\})$ and $(B = \{a, b\})$, then $(A \times B = \{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)\})$.

#### What properties does the Cartesian product of sets have?
- The number of elements in the Cartesian product is the product of the number of elements in the original sets: $(|A \times B| = |A| \cdot |B|)$.
- The Cartesian product is associative: $((A \times B) \times C = A \times (B \times C))$.
- The Cartesian product is commutative: $(A \times B = B \times A)$.

#### How to compute the number of elements in the Cartesian product of two sets?
- The number of elements in the Cartesian product $(A \times B)$ is equal to the product of the number of elements in sets A and B.

#### What are the main uses of the Cartesian product in computer science and information technology?
- In databases for modeling relationships between tables.
- In graph theory for representing the Cartesian product of graphs.
- In programming for iterating over all possible combinations of elements from two sets.

## 7. Concept of Relation. Ways of Specifying Relations.

### Concept of Relation:

In mathematics, a relation is a special kind of subset of the Cartesian product of a set with itself. For sets A and B, a relation R between A and B is defined as a subset of A × B. An element (a, b) belongs to the relation R if and only if the pair a and b are related by R. Relations can be graphically or tabularly represented and are essential for analyzing and modeling various relationships in mathematics and other fields.

### Ways of Specifying Relations:

#### Tabular Method:

> A relation can be specified using a table, where rows represent elements from set A, columns represent elements from set B, and marked cells indicate whether the pair (a, b) belongs to the relation.

For example, if A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {a, b}, and the relation R is given as {(1, a), (2, b), (3, a)}, the table may look like this:

|   | a | b |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | x |   |
| 2 |   | x |
| 3 | x |   |

#### Literary or Descriptive Method:

> A relation can be described in words or algorithmically, for example, "R is a relation on A and B, where each number in the pair from A has a corresponding element in B."

#### Graphical Method:

> A relation can be represented as a graph, where vertices correspond to elements from sets A and B, and edges indicate pairs belonging to the relation.

#### Algebraic Method:

> A relation can be defined algebraically using formulas or equations that determine its properties.

## 8. Images and Preimages of Elements and Sets with Respect to Relations. Operations on Relations.

1. **Image of an Element under a Relation:**
   - For an element a from set A and relation R between A and B, the image of element a, denoted as R(a), is the set of all elements b from set B such that (a, b) belongs to the relation R.

2. **Preimage of an Element under a Relation:**
   - For an element b from set B and relation R between

 A and B, the preimage of element b, denoted as R^(-1)(b) or R^(-1)[b], is the set of all elements a from set A such that (a, b) belongs to the relation R.

3. **Image of a Set under a Relation:**
   - For a set X from set A and relation R between A and B, the image of set X, denoted as R(X), is the union of images of all elements from X.

4. **Preimage of a Set under a Relation:**
   - For a set Y from set B and relation R between A and B, the preimage of set Y, denoted as R^(-1)(Y) or R^(-1)[Y], is the union of preimages of all elements from Y.

### Operations on Relations:

1. **Union of Relations:**
   - For relations R and S between A and B, the union of R and S, denoted as R ∪ S, is the relation that contains pairs (a, b) that belong to either R, S, or both.

2. **Intersection of Relations:**
   - For relations R and S between A and B, the intersection of R and S, denoted as R ∩ S, is the relation that contains pairs (a, b) that belong to both R and S.

3. **Difference of Relations:**
   - For relations R and S between A and B, the difference R \ S, denoted as R - S, is the relation that contains pairs (a, b) that belong to R but not to S.

4. **Inverse of a Relation:**
   - The inverse relation R^(-1) between B and A is defined as the set of all pairs (b, a) where (a, b) belongs to R.

These concepts and operations provide a foundation for studying and manipulating relations between sets.

## 9. Properties of Binary Relations.

**Binary relation R between sets A and B is a subset of their Cartesian product A × B. Properties of binary relations are important for their analysis and understanding of their behavior. Here are some basic properties of binary relations:**

1. **Reflexivity:**
   - Relation R is reflexive on set A if, for every element a in A, ((a, a) ∈ R).

2. **Symmetry:**
   - Relation R is symmetric if, for every pair (a, b) ∈ R, (b, a) ∈ R.

3. **Transitivity:**
   - Relation R is transitive if, for every two pairs (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, (a, c) ∈ R.

4. **Antisymmetry:**
   - Relation R is antisymmetric if, for every two distinct elements a and b in set A, if (a, b) ∈ R, then (b, a) ∉ R.

5. **Antireflexivity (Irreflexivity):**
   - Relation R is antireflexive (irreflexive) if, for every element a in A, (a, a) ∉ R.

6. **Equivalence Relation:**
   - Relation R is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

7. **Order Relations:**
   - If relation R satisfies antisymmetry and transitivity, it is called an order relation.

These properties are crucial for understanding the characteristics and use of binary relations in mathematics, logic, computer science, and other fields.

## 10. Concept of Combinatorial Problem. Sum Rule. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. Product Rule (Fundamental Principle of Combinatorics).

### Concept of Combinatorial Problem:
Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that studies variations and ways of choosing objects from a finite set or arranging them in a certain order. Combinatorial problems involve counting different combinations, permutations, subsets, and other objects.

### Sum Rule:
The Sum Rule states that if an object can be chosen by one of several mutually exclusive or non-overlapping events, then the total number of ways to choose the object is the sum of the number of ways for each event.

### Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:
The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle is used to calculate the number of objects belonging to at least one of several sets. The general idea is to add the number of objects in each set, subtract the number of objects in the intersection of two or more sets, add back the number in the intersection of three or more sets, and continue this process to avoid double counting.

### Product Rule (Fundamental Principle of Combinatorics):
The Product Rule states that if an object can be chosen in m ways and, independently of the first choice, a second object can be chosen in n ways, then there are m * n ways to choose both objects.

In general, combinatorics allows solving problems related to counting objects, selection, arrangement, and their combinations, finding applications in various fields such as probability theory, algorithms, coding theory, and more.

## 11. Combinatorial Configurations without Repetition.

### 1. Permutations without Repetition:

Permutation without repetition of a set with n elements is an ordered set of all possible arrangements of these elements. The number of permutations without repetition for a set with n elements is n! (n-factorial).

$$n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \ldots \cdot 2 \cdot 1$$

### 2. Arrangements without Repetition:

Arrangements without repetition of a set with n elements and choosing m elements are ordered sets of all possible arrangements of m elements from the set of n. The number of arrangements without repetition is calculated by the formula $( P(n, m) = \frac{n!}{(n-m)!} )$.

### 3. Combinations without Repetition:

Combinations without repetition of a set with n elements and choosing m elements are all possible subsets of size m that can be formed from the set of n. The number of combinations without repetition is calculated by the formula $( C(n, m) = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!} )$.

### 4. Properties of the Number of Combinations:

   - Symmetry: $( C(n, m) = C(n, n-m) )$.
   - Sum over all m: $( C(n, 0) + C(n, 1) + \ldots + C(n, n) = 2^n )$.

### 5. Geometric Interpretation of the Number of Combinations:

The number of combinations C(n, m) represents the number of all possible paths of choosing m elements from a set of n, where order does not matter. Geometrically, this can be imagined, for example, as the number of paths on a graph, where nodes represent elements, and edges indicate the possibility of choosing between them.

## 12. Combinatorial Configurations with Repetition.

### 1. Permutations with Repetition:

Permutation with repetition for a set with n elements, where some elements may be repeated, is an ordered set of all possible arrangements of these elements. The number of permutations with repetition for a set with n elements (where some elements may be repeated) and choosing m elements is determined by the formula $n^m$.

### 2. Arrangements with Repetition:

Arrangements with repetition for a set with n elements and choosing m elements are ordered sets of all possible arrangements of m elements from the set of n, where elements can be repeated. The number of arrangements with repetition is determined by the formula: $(n^m)$.

### 3. Combinations with Repetition:

Combinations with repetition for a set with n elements and choosing m elements are all possible subsets of size m that can be formed from the set of n, where elements can be repeated. The number of combinations with repetition is determined by the formula: $( C(n + m -1, m) )$.

These combinatorial configurations with repetition are important for modeling situations where one or more objects can be chosen more than once.

## 13. Concept of Binary Algebraic Operation.

Binary algebraic operation is an operation that combines two elements to form a new element in algebraic structure. The operation is binary as it acts on two operands (two elements of a set) and generates a third element of the same set.

In binary algebra, commonly used operations include:

1. **Addition (+):** For numerical systems like integers, rational numbers, real numbers, as well as for matrices and vectors.

2. **Multiplication (· or *):** Also applied in various numerical systems, matrices, vectors, etc.

3. **Subtraction (-):** For numerical systems where subtraction is defined.

4. **Division (/):** For numerical systems where division is defined.

5. **Logical Operations:** For example, logical AND, logical OR, logical NOT in Boolean algebra.

6. **Concatenation:** In strings or sequences.

7. **Function Composition (f ∘ g):** For functions f and g.

Binary algebraic operations play a crucial role in mathematics, logic, computer science, and other fields.

 They are a fundamental element of algebraic structures such as groups, rings, fields, etc.

## 14. Properties of Binary Algebraic Operations.

Properties of binary algebraic operations define the fundamental characteristics of these operations in various algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, fields, etc. The basic properties include commutativity, associativity, identity element, inversion, and distributivity. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Commutativity:**
   - **Addition:** a + b = b + a
   - **Multiplication:** a * b = b * a

2. **Associativity:**
   - **Addition:** (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
   - **Multiplication:** (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)

3. **Identity Element:**
   - **Addition:** a + 0 = a (there exists an element 0 such that adding it to any element doesn't change it)
   - **Multiplication:** a * 1 = a (there exists an element 1 such that multiplying it doesn't change the value)

4. **Inversion:**
   - **Addition:** a + (-a) = 0 (there exists an inverse element -a such that their sum gives the identity element)
   - **Multiplication:** For an element a != 0, there exists an inverse element a^-1 such that a * a^-1 = 1

5. **Distributivity:**
   - **Multiplication distributes over addition:** a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c

These properties define algebraic structures and play a key role in solving various mathematical and computer science problems. They form the foundation for understanding and using algebraic operations in different fields of mathematics and science.

## 15. Inverse Binary Operations.

**Inverse binary operations** are operations that are inverse to certain binary operations, restoring the original result after applying the original operation. Here are several basic examples of inverse binary operations:

1. **Inverse Addition:**
   - For every element **a**, there exists an inverse element -a such that a + (-a) = 0.

2. **Inverse Subtraction:**
   - For every element **a**, there exists an inverse element -a such that a - a = 0.

3. **Inverse Multiplication:**
   - For every non-zero element **a**, there exists an inverse element **a^-1** such that a * a^-1 = 1.

4. **Inverse Division:**
   - For every non-zero element **a**, there exists an inverse element **a^-1** such that a / a^-1 = 1.

Inverse binary operations play an important role in algebraic theory and mathematical areas. They allow defining the inverses of elements in algebraic structures and are used to solve various mathematical equations and systems.

## 16. Elements Invariant with Respect to Binary Operation.

An element invariant with respect to a binary operation is an element of a set that remains unchanged (invariant) when the binary operation is applied to it. That is, if we apply the binary operation to the invariant element and any other element of the set, the result remains the same as the invariant element.

For example, for addition, the invariant element is 0 since for any **a**, a + 0 = a remains unchanged. Similarly, for multiplication, the invariant element is 1, as a * 1 = a for any **a**.

In the case of inverse operations, if we are looking for an element that remains unchanged when the inverse operation is applied, for addition, it is 0, and for multiplication, it is 1.

These elements have significant importance in algebra and mathematics, and their properties are utilized in studying various algebraic structures and solving equations.

## 17. Concept of Algebraic Structure.

An algebraic structure is a mathematical structure consisting of a set, along with one or more algebraic operations and corresponding properties. The main types of algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, and others. Let's explore some of them:

1. **Group:**
   - **Definition:** A set G together with a binary operation * is called a group if it satisfies four fundamental properties: closure, associativity, existence of an identity element, and existence of inverse elements.
   - **Properties:** In addition to the properties of a semigroup, it has an identity element (e) such that a * e = e * a = a for any element a, and every element has an inverse element.

2. **Ring:**
   - **Definition:** A set R with two binary operations, usually called addition (+) and multiplication (*), is called a ring if it satisfies properties such as associativity for addition and multiplication, distributivity of multiplication over addition, and the existence of an additive identity element (zero).

3. **Field:**
   - **Definition:** A field is a set F with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying the properties of a ring and additional properties such as commutativity for multiplication and the existence of multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements.

4. **Vector Space:**
   - **Definition:** A set V with two binary operations, addition and scalar multiplication, and a field F is called a vector space over F if it satisfies various properties, including closure under addition and scalar multiplication, associativity, and distributivity.

These algebraic structures are studied in abstract algebra and mathematical logic. They are used to solve diverse mathematical problems and find applications in various branches of mathematics and science.

## 18. Basic Types of Algebraic Structures:

### 1. Algebraic Structures with a Single Binary Operation:

#### 1.1 Semigroup:
- **Definition:** A semigroup is a set with an associative binary operation.
- **Properties:** It only includes the associative property, meaning for all elements a, b, c in the set, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).

#### 1.2 Group:
- **Definition:** A group is a set with a binary operation that satisfies four basic properties: closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverse elements.
- **Properties:** In addition to semigroup properties, it has an identity element (e) such that a * e = e * a = a, and every element has an inverse element.

### 2. Algebraic Structures with Two Binary Operations:

#### 2.1 Ring:
- **Definition:** A ring is a set with two binary operations, typically called addition and multiplication, satisfying properties such as associativity, distributivity, and the existence of an additive identity (zero).
- **Properties:** While it has properties of a semigroup and a group under addition, it may not have inverses under multiplication.

#### 2.2 Field:
- **Definition:** A field is a set with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying the properties of a ring and additional properties like commutativity of multiplication and the existence of multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements.

These algebraic structures play a crucial role in mathematics, providing frameworks for studying and solving mathematical problems in various domains.

## 19. Isomorphisms and Homomorphisms of Algebraic Structures

**Isomorphism of Algebraic Structures:**

Isomorphism is a mutually one-to-one mapping between two algebraic structures that preserves algebraic operations. If there is an isomorphism between two algebraic structures, then these structures are essentially the same in terms of their algebraic properties.

For two algebraic structures A and B, the isomorphism is denoted as phi: A -> B. The conditions of isomorphism include:

1. One-to-one correspondence: The isomorphism phi is mutually one-to-one, meaning for each element a in A, there is a unique element b in B such that phi(a) = b.

2. Operation preservation: The isomorphism preserves operations. That is, for all elements a and b in A, phi(a * b) = phi(a) * phi(b), where * is the operation in A, and * is the operation in B.

**Homomorphism of Algebraic Structures:**

Homomorphism is a mapping between two algebraic structures that preserves algebraic operations but is not necessarily mutually one-to-one.

For two algebraic structures A and B, the homomorphism is denoted as phi: A -> B. The conditions of homomorphism include:

1. Operation preservation: The homomorphism preserves operations. That is, for all elements a and b in A, phi(a * b) = phi(a) * phi(b), where * is the operation in A, and * is the operation in B.

Isomorphisms and homomorphisms are important concepts in algebra and group theory, rings, fields, and other algebraic structures. They allow for comparisons and classifications of various algebraic structures and the study of their properties.

## 20. Concept of Boolean Function

**Boolean Function** - is a function that takes Boolean values (usually 0 or 1) as input and returns a Boolean value as the output. Boolean functions are widely used in logic, combinatorics, algebra, electronics, and other areas where working with logical values is crucial.

**Examples of Boolean functions:**

1. *Logical AND:* Denoted as f(x, y) = x * y.
   - | x | y | f(x, y) |
     |---|---|---------|
     | 0 | 0 |    0    |
     | 0 | 1 |    0    |
     | 1 | 0 |    0    |
     | 1 | 1 |    1    |

2. *Logical OR:* Denoted as f(x, y) = x + y.
   - | x | y | f(x, y) |
     |---|---|---------|
     | 0 | 0 |    0    |
     | 0 | 1 |    1    |
     | 1 | 0 |    1    |
     | 1 | 1 |    1    |

3. *Logical NOT:* Denoted as f(x) = ¬x.
   - | x | f(x) |
     |---|------|
     | 0 |   1  |
     | 1 |   0  |

4. *Exclusive OR (XOR):* Denoted as f(x, y) = x ⊕ y.
   - | x | y | f(x, y) |
     |---|---|---------|
     | 0 | 0 |    0    |
     | 0 | 1 |    1    |
     | 1 | 0 |    1    |
     | 1 | 1 |    0    |

Boolean functions are a fundamental element of logic and digital systems. They are used to describe and analyze logical operations and to design and construct logical circuits in electronics.

## 21. Ways to Represent Boolean Functions

Boolean functions can be represented in various ways using different forms of representation. Here are a few fundamental methods:

1. **Truth Table:**
    - The simplest way to represent Boolean functions.
    displays all possible combinations of input values and their corresponding output values.
        - Example:
        -   | x | y | f(x, y) |
            |---|---|---------|
            | 0 | 0 |    0    |
            | 0 | 1 |    1    |
            | 1 | 0 |    1    |
            | 1 | 1 |    0    |

2. **Algebraic Expression:**
   - An expression that uses algebraic operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) to describe the function.
   - Example: `f(x, y) = x * ~y + ~x * y`.

3. **Circuit Diagram:**
   - A graphical representation of a logical circuit that shows logical relationships between input and output variables.
   - Uses logical elements such as AND gates, OR gates, and NOT gates.
   - Example:
    ```haskell
     _____
    |     |
    | AND |----- f
    |_____|
     /\  |
     |   |
     |   |
     |___|
      |
      x
    ```

4. **Karnaugh Map:**
   - A graphical method for simplifying and analyzing Boolean functions.
   - Uses squares representing possible input value combinations.
   - Applied to optimize functions.
        - Example:
           - | AB | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 |
             |----|----|----|----|----|
             | 0  |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |
             | 1  |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |

5. **Truth Vector:**
   - Uses a vector where each bit represents the output value for a specific combination of input values.
   - Example: For the function `f(x, y) = x XOR y`, the truth vector would be `1101`.

Each of these methods has its advantages depending on the specific application and tasks related to Boolean functions.

## 22. Number of Boolean Functions of n Variables

The number of possible Boolean functions for n Boolean variables (arguments) can be calculated as 2^(2^n). This stems from the fact that for each Boolean variable, there are two possible values (0 or 1), and the total number of possible combinations for n variables is 2^n.

For each of these combinations, there can be two possible output values (0 or 1), so for each combination of input values, there are 2^2 = 4 possible Boolean functions.

Therefore, the total number of Boolean functions for n Boolean variables is 2^(2^n).

For example:
- For one Boolean variable (n = 1): 2^(2^1) = 2^2 = 4 Boolean functions.
- For two Boolean variables (n = 2): 2^(2^2) = 2^4 = 16 Boolean functions.
- For three Boolean variables (n = 3): 2^(2^3) = 2^8 = 256 Boolean functions.

This number grows rapidly with an increase in the number of Boolean variables, and it represents an important aspect of the theory of Boolean functions and their applications in logic, computational techniques, and other fields.

## 23. Elementary Boolean Functions

**Elementary Boolean Functions** are basic logical operations that can be used to construct any other Boolean function. These functions are defined for one or two Boolean arguments and form a fundamental set of operations from which more complex logical functions can be built.

The primary elementary Boolean functions include:

1. **Logical NOT (NOT):**
   - Notation: $(f(x) = \overline{x})$
   - Truth table:
     - | x | f(x) |
       |---|------|
       | 0 |   1  |
       | 1 |   0  |

2. **Logical AND:**
   - Notation: $(f(x, y) = x \cdot y)$
   - Truth table:
     - | x | y | f(x, y) |
       |---|---|---------|
       | 0 | 0 |    0    |
       | 0 | 1 |    0    |
       | 1 | 0 |    0    |
       | 1 | 1 |    1    |

3. **Logical OR:**
   - Notation: $(f(x, y) = x + y)$
   - Truth table:
     - | x | y | f(x, y) |
       |---|---|---------|
       | 0 | 0 |    0    |
       | 0 | 1 |    1    |
       | 1 | 0 |    1    |
       | 1 | 1 |    1    |

4. **Logical XOR (Exclusive OR):**
   - Notation: $(f(x, y) = x \oplus y)$
   - Truth table:
     - | x | y | f(x, y) |
       |---|---|---------|
       | 0 | 0 |    0    |
       | 0 | 1 |    1    |
       | 1 | 0 |    1    |
       | 1 | 1 |    0    |

These elementary Boolean functions serve as the basic building blocks for constructing more complex Boolean functions and logical circuits.

## 24. Implementation of Boolean Functions by Formulas

1. **Logical AND:**
    - Boolean formula: `f(x, y) = x * y`
2. **Logical OR:**
    - Boolean formula: `f(x, y) = x + y`
3. **Logical NOT:**
    - Boolean formula: `f(x) = ~x` or `f(x) = 1 + x`
4. **Logical XOR:**
    - Boolean formula: `f(x, y) = x ^ y` or `f(x, y) = (x + y) * (~x + ~y)`

These formulas use elementary Boolean operations to construct more complex functions. It's important to note that these formulas represent an algebraic way of describing functions, and they can be used for analysis and optimization of Boolean expressions.

The implementation of Boolean functions may also involve the use of logical expressions in programming or in the context of working with logical circuits in electronics. In programming, Boolean functions can be expressed using conditional statements, loops, and other language constructs.

## 25. Equivalence and Identity of Formulas

**Equivalence of Formulas:**

Two Boolean formulas are considered equivalent if they yield the same values for all possible combinations of input values. Equivalence indicates that these formulas perform the same logical operations and represent the same Boolean function.

It is denoted as the equivalence of two formulas: $(f1 \equiv f2)$, where $(f1)$ and $(f2)$ are two Boolean formulas.

**Identity of Formulas:**

Two Boolean formulas are considered identical if they yield the same values for all possible combinations of input values, and they represent the exact same Boolean function. Identity means that these formulas are interchangeable in any logical expression without changing its value.

It is denoted as the identity of two formulas: $(f1 \equiv f2)$, where $(f1)$ and $(f2)$ are two Boolean formulas.

**Examples:**

- If we have the formulas $(A * (B + C))$ and $(A * B + A * C)$, they are equivalent because they represent the same logical operations.
- However, if we have the formulas $(A + 0)$ and $(A)$, they are identical because their values match for all possible combinations of the variable A.

## 26. Principle of Duality

For any Boolean function $f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, there exists a dual Boolean function $g(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ such that for any input vector $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, the following equality holds.

### Explanation

- If $(f)$ evaluates to 1 for a specific input vector, then \(g\) evaluates to 0 for the same input vector, and vice versa.
- Therefore, one can use De Morgan's theorem to obtain $(g)$ from the values of $(f)$, and vice versa.

The Principle of Duality is particularly useful when working with Boolean functions, as it allows for the representation of one function in terms of another. This can be important for the analysis and optimization of Boolean expressions.

## 27. Disjunctive and Conjunctive Normal Forms

**Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF):**

1. Disjunctive Normal Form is a logical expression that represents a disjunction of conjunctions of Boolean variables or their negations. In other words, it is the sum of products.

2. For example, the DNF for the function $f(x, y, z) = xy + \overline{x}z)$ looks like:
    $$f(x, y, z) = (x \cdot y) + (\overline{x} \cdot z)$$

3. In DNF, the function is expressed as a disjunction of conjunctions, where each term corresponds to one combination of input variables for which the function evaluates to 1.

**Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF):**

1. Conjunctive Normal Form is a logical expression that represents a conjunction of disjunctions of Boolean variables or their negations. It is the product of sums.

2. For example, the CNF for the function $f(x, y, z) = (x + y) \cdot (\overline{x} + z)$ looks like:
    $$f(x, y, z) = (x \cdot \overline{x}) + (x \cdot z) + (y \cdot \overline{x}) + (y \cdot z)$$

3. In CNF, the function is expressed as a conjunction of disjunctions, where each term corresponds to one combination of input variables for which the function evaluates to 0.

4. Both DNF and CNF are important for working with Boolean functions, and they are applied in the analysis, optimization, and implementation of these functions in logical circuits and programs.

## 28. Perfect Disjunctive and Conjunctive Normal Forms.

**Perfect Disjunctive Normal Form (PDNF):**

Perfect Disjunctive Normal Form is a Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) in which there are no redundant (unnecessary) terms, i.e., those that have a value of 0 for all combinations of input values where the function evaluates to 1.

For example, for the function $f(x, y, z) = x \cdot y + \overline{x} \cdot z)$, the PDNF would be:

$$f(x, y, z) = x \cdot y + \overline{x} \cdot z$$

In this case, each term is essential for expressing the function.

**Perfect Conjunctive Normal Form (PCNF):**

Perfect Conjunctive Normal Form is a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) in which there are no redundant (unnecessary) factors, i.e., those that have a value of 1 for all combinations of input values where the function evaluates to 0.

For example, for the function $f(x, y, z) = (x + y) \cdot (\overline{x} + z)$, the PCNF would be:

$$f(x, y, z) = (x + y) \cdot (\overline{x} + z)$$

In this case, each factor is essential for expressing the function.

Using perfect forms can simplify the representation of Boolean functions and facilitate their analysis and optimization.

## 29. Reducing Boolean Functions to Perfect Disjunctive and Conjunctive Normal Forms.

Reducing a Boolean function to Perfect Disjunctive Normal Form (PDNF) and Perfect Conjunctive Normal Form (PCNF) involves removing redundant terms or factors from the expression. Below is a general approach to reducing a Boolean function to perfect normal forms:

### Reducing to PDNF:

1. **Write the function in DNF:** Begin by representing the Boolean function in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), where each term represents a combination of input variables for which the function evaluates to 1.

2. **Identify redundant terms:** Find terms that have a value of 0 for all possible combinations of input variables.

3. **Eliminate redundant terms:** Eliminate redundant terms from the DNF.

4. **Express the remaining terms as PDNF:** Write the remaining (non-redundant) terms as the Perfect Disjunctive Normal Form (PDNF).

### Reducing to PCNF:

1. **Write the function in CNF:** Start by representing the Boolean function in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), where each factor represents a combination of input variables for which the function evaluates to 0.

2. **Identify redundant factors:** Identify factors that have a value of 1 for all possible combinations of input variables.

3. **Eliminate redundant factors:** Eliminate redundant factors from the CNF.

4. **Express the remaining factors as PCNF:** Write the remaining (non-redundant) factors as the Perfect Conjunctive Normal Form (PCNF).

After these steps, you will obtain the perfect disjunctive and conjunctive normal forms, respectively. Note that some functions may not have perfect normal forms, but this process helps minimize the number of terms or factors in the expression.

## 30. Complete Systems of Boolean Functions.

Complete Systems of Boolean Functions are sets of Boolean functions that can express any other Boolean function that takes values 0 or 1 for its input arguments. Such systems are a fundamental concept in the theory of Boolean functions and logical expressions. Two of the most well-known classic examples of complete systems of Boolean functions are the conjunction and negation (AND and NOT) or the conjunction and disjunction (AND and OR).

### Conjunction and Negation (AND and NOT):

1. **Conjunction (AND):** Represented as $f(x, y) = xy$. The function evaluates to 1 only when both arguments `x` and `y` are equal to 1.

2. **Negation (NOT):** Represented as $f(x) = \overline{x}$. The function evaluates to 1 if the argument `x` is equal to 0, and vice versa.

These two functions form a complete system of Boolean functions since any other Boolean function can be expressed using them.

### Conjunction and Disjunction (AND and OR):

1. **Conjunction (AND):** As in the previous example.

2. **Disjunction (OR):** Represented as $f(x, y) = x + y$. The function evaluates to 1 if at least one of the arguments `x` or `y` is equal to 1.

This pair of functions also forms a complete system of Boolean functions.

Other complete systems of Boolean functions exist, such as a set with NAND (NOT AND) or a set with NOR (NOT OR), where only one of these functions is basic (AND or OR), and the other is generated using negation (NOT). The essential property of complete systems is that they can express any other Boolean function, making them a key element in digital design and computational theory.

## 30. Complete Systems of Boolean Functions.

Complete systems of Boolean functions are sets of Boolean functions that can express any other Boolean function, which takes values 0 or 1 for its input arguments. Such systems are a fundamental concept in the theory of Boolean functions and logical expressions. Two of the most well-known classic examples of complete systems of Boolean functions are the conjunction and negation (AND and NOT), or the conjunction and disjunction (AND and OR).

### Conjunction and Negation (AND and NOT):

1. **Conjunction (AND):** Denoted as $f(x, y) = xy$. The function takes the value 1 only when both arguments `x` and `y` are equal to 1.

2. **Negation (NOT):** Denoted as $f(x) = \overline{x}$. The function takes the value 1 if the argument `x` is equal to 0, and vice versa.

These two functions form a complete system of Boolean functions since any other Boolean function can be expressed using them.

### Conjunction and Disjunction (AND and OR):

1. **Conjunction (AND):** Similar to the previous example.

2. **Disjunction (OR):** Denoted as `f(x, y) = x + y`. The function takes the value 1 if at least one of the arguments `x` or `y` is equal to 1.

This pair of functions also forms a complete system of Boolean functions.

There are other complete systems of Boolean functions, such as a set of NAND (NOT AND) or a set of NOR (NOT OR), where only one of these functions is basic (AND or OR), and the other is generated by negation (NOT). The crucial property of complete systems is that they can express any other Boolean function, making them a key element in digital design and the theory of computation.

## 31. Representation of Boolean Functions by Zhegalkin Polynomials.

Zhegalkin polynomial is a representation of a Boolean function as a polynomial over the field $(GF(2))$ (Galois field with two elements) or, in other words, a variant of a polynomial over the Boolean ring:

$$(\mathbb{Z}_2)$$

Boolean functions can be represented as Zhegalkin polynomials using variables $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, where each $(x_i)$ takes values 0 or 1. The general form of a Zhegalkin polynomial looks like this:

$$f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = \sum_{S \subseteq \{1,2,...,n\}} a_S \cdot \prod_{i \in S} x_i$$

where $(S)$ is a subset of the set $(\{1,2,...,n\}$, and $(a_S)$ are coefficients taking values 0 or 1.

For example, for the function $f(x, y) = x \oplus y$ (XOR), the Zhegalkin polynomial looks like this:

$$f(x, y) = x \oplus y = x + y - 2xy$$

where $(\oplus)$ corresponds to $XOR$, and $(-2xy)$ accounts for excluding $(2xy)$.

The advantage of representing Boolean functions as Zhegalkin polynomials is the ability to use algebraic methods for analysis and optimization. Additionally, this representation is convenient for certain applications, such as in digital design.

## 34. Minimization Problem of Boolean Functions.

The minimization problem of Boolean functions involves finding an equivalent expression with fewer variables, terms, or factors and the same or fewer logical operations. Minimizing Boolean functions is a crucial task in digital design, logical synthesis, and optimization of logical circuits.

There are two main methods for minimizing Boolean functions: algebraic methods and the Karnaugh map.

### 1. Algebraic Methods:

These methods are based on the properties of Boolean algebra and logic laws. One such method is the Quine-McCluskey method, which uses tabulation to find prime implicants and their combinations.

### 2. Karnaugh Map:

The Karnaugh map is a graphical method for Boolean function minimization, allowing for visualization and simplification. The Karnaugh map is suitable for functions dependent on a small number of variables (usually no more than 6 or 7).

The basic steps of minimization using the Karnaugh map:

1. **Constructing the Karnaugh map:** Build a Karnaugh map where each cell corresponds to a possible combination of input values. Record the function values (0 or 1) accordingly.

2. **Grouping ones:** Group adjacent cells that have the same value. Groups should be areas of a power of two (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).

3. **Selecting prime implicants:** Select prime implicants covering all ones on the map. Each group cell represents a prime implicant.

4. **Building the minimized expression:** Compose the minimized expression using selected prime implicants.

Minimizing Boolean functions is essential for reducing the number of logic elements and optimizing logical circuits, leading to resource savings and improved performance.

## 35. Minimization Methods for Boolean Functions in DNF Class.

### 1. **Quine-McCluskey Method for Boolean Function Minimization:**

The Quine-McCluskey method is an algebraic method for minimizing Boolean functions in the Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) class. The main idea involves using tabulation to find prime implicants and their combinations. The steps of the method include:

1. **Tabulation:** Create a tabulation containing all possible implicants of the given Boolean function.

2. **Grouping Implicants:** Group implicants by the number of ones in their binary representation.

3. **Combining Implicants:** Combine implicants that differ by only one bit. This step is repeated until no more combinations are possible.

4. **Selecting Prime Implicants:** Identify and select prime implicants from the combined groups, ensuring that each one covers a unique set of minterms.

5. **Building the Minimized Expression:** Construct the minimized expression using the selected prime implicants.

### 2. **Karnaugh-Veitch Map for Boolean Function Minimization:**

The Karnaugh-Veitch method is a graphical method for minimizing Boolean functions that uses the Karnaugh map to visualize dependencies between function values for all possible input combinations.

Key steps of the Karnaugh-Veitch method:

1. **Constructing the Karnaugh Map:** Build a Karnaugh map with cells corresponding to possible input combinations and record function values (0 or 1).

2. **Grouping Ones:** Group adjacent cells with the same value. Groups should be areas of a power of two.

3. **Selecting Prime Implicants:** Select prime implicants covering all ones on the map. Each group cell represents a prime implicant.

4. **Building the Minimized Expression:** Compose the minimized expression using selected prime implicants.

Both of these methods are effective for minimizing Boolean functions in the DNF class and are chosen based on specific scenarios.

## 36. Implementation of Boolean Functions using Functional Elements.

The implementation of Boolean functions using functional elements is a crucial task in digital design. Functional elements such as logic gates, triggers, multiplexers, and others can be used to construct complex digital circuits that perform specific Boolean functions. Here are several steps typically used in implementing Boolean functions:

1. **Function Definition:** Specify the Boolean function you want to implement as a logical expression or another suitable representation.

2. **Function Minimization:** Use one of the minimization methods (e.g., Quine-McCluskey method or Karnaugh map method) to obtain a simplified expression for the Boolean function.

3. **Selection of Functional Elements:** Choose functional elements that suit your needs. These could be logic gates, multiplexers, decoders, and others.

4. **Circuit Construction:** Assemble a circuit from the selected functional elements, where each element corresponds to a part of the Boolean expression.

5. **Connecting Elements:** Connect the outputs of some functional elements to the inputs of others, as specified in the simplified Boolean expression.

6. **Verification and Optimization:** Check the correctness and efficiency of the circuit. If possible, perform additional optimization, such as reducing the number of used elements or minimizing delays.

7. **Implementation on Hardware:** Implement the circuit on physical hardware, using real logic gates, integrated circuits, or programmable logic devices such as FPGAs or CPLDs.

This process requires a careful analysis of the Boolean function, selection of appropriate functional elements, and proper circuit construction. Achieving an optimal solution may involve various compromises between resource costs, speed, and other system characteristics.
