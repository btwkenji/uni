Task 3. Who is in the house of the stranger.

- Marichka and Anton quarreled because they were constantly short of money. To
  find out who is to blame for this, they decided to calculate the family budget
  for N months.
- Each reporting week, they recorded who earned how much money and who spent how
  much money. If someone had money left over at the end of the week, the person
  put it in their own piggy bank. It was not possible to take money from the
  piggy bank until the end of the experiment. If someone did not have enough
  money during the week, they could borrow the shortfall from their parents.
- The input data of the problem are: information about everyone's weekly
  expenses, information about everyone's weekly earnings, information about
  weekly borrowing money from parents.

- 1. How much money has everyone accumulated in the treasury for N weeks.
- 2. Who is the bigger tranjira.
- 3. Whose average balance is better.
