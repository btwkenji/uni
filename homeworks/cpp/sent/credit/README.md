# Task: Loan

A person took a loan from the bank in the amount of UAH X. Every month, a person pays a certain amount based on his financial capabilities. The monthly fee set by the bank is at least 5% of the remaining amount of the loan. If the person pays less, the loan amount increases by 0.05% of the loan balance.

The program interface should provide the following:
1. Entering the total amount X from the keyboard.
2. Entering the next amount of payments.
3. After each entry of the next amount, it is necessary to display how much the person still has to pay.
   - Additionally, display a message if the person has paid less than 5% of the remaining amount of the loan, indicating that the amount has increased.
