# Task: Medical Research

N candidates were recruited for selection to participate in a medical study. As a result of evaluating the candidates' indicators according to some criteria, each of them received a score on a scale from 0 to 10, which determines the degree of his suitability for participation in the study.

Candidates who scored less than X points are not suitable for participation in the study. The program should form a set of only those who are suitable for participation in the study from the input set of indicators of all N candidates. If as a result of the selection, none of the candidates scored the required number of points, display the corresponding message.

**Program Implementation Options:**

1. **Create a New Array:**
   - Create a new array with the data of those candidates who are eligible to participate.

2. **Modify Input Array:**
   - Delete from the input array those candidates who are not eligible to participate.
