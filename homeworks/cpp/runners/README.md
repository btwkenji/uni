# Task: Runners

For selection for participation in running competitions, M training runs were conducted among N participants. Based on the results of the runs, a table was compiled, where each column is the data of one runner.

If the runner was disqualified within the race, then the value -1 was entered into the table; otherwise, the time in seconds.

Make a program that:

1. Allows you to enter data on each participant of the races and displays the table of races.
2. Determines how many runners were disqualified at least once.
3. Displays the best and worst result for all races without taking into account disqualifications (output only time).
4. Displays the best and worst result of each runner (without taking into account disqualifications).
5. Displays the numbers of runners who got the best result among all races.

Test table of races:

- 20 30 23 -1
- -1 30 30 -1
- 30 28 30 28
- -1 -1 -1 -1
- 27 30 28 29
