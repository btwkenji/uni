## The problem "Everything is mixed up"

- Feeding on the farm through an automated feeder is organized twice a day. The
  feeding plan is drawn up for a month and includes 2 numbers for each day: the
  weight of food in the morning, the weight of food in the evening (in
  kilograms).
- When forming the plan, the operator made a mistake and confused the evening
  and daytime rates. Make a program that corrects the plan by changing the norms
  for each day.

Test example (fragment of the plan for 3 days):

```
Entry plan: 10, 7, 12, 9, 12, 10, 15, 13
Adjusted plan: 7, 10, 9, 12, 10, 12, 13, 15
```
